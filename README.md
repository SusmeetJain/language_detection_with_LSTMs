## Language Detection with LSTMs

----
### About this project
Recurrent Neural Networks are extremely powerful in capturing sequential information. In this project we use that power for identifying the language a given sentence is written in! Before the advent of neural networks, this kind of task would have relied on a rule based system.

### using this project
 - The data for this project is in the file "all-sentences.txt"
 - All the analysis, including data pre processing, EDA and modeling is in the ipython notebook "lang_det_lstm.ipynb"
